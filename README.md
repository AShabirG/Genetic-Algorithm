Beyond this, I implemented tournament selection in place of fitness proportionate selection to compare the effectiveness of the two selection methods. There is minimal difference between the code (10 lines between tournament selection and fitness proportionate) but the task required they all be submitted as individual files and hence the need for 4 files. 

The report shows the results of these simulations and draws a comparison between the original papers results and the reproduced speaking to its reproducibility.
